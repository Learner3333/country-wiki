displays the detailed information about that country.

### Search Functionality: The user interface should provide two search options:

- __Search by Name:__ Allow users to search for a country by its name. When a
user enters a country name in the search field and submits the form, the
system should display a filtered list of countries matching the search query.
Clicking on a country in the filtered list should display its details.

- __Search by Code:__ Allow users to search for a country by its code. When a
user enters a country code in the search field and submits the form, the
system should fetch the country details using the corresponding API
endpoint and display the information.


### Database Integration
- We need to store the search keyword in the database.
- For example, if a user search 
India then should get recorded in the database with the count.
